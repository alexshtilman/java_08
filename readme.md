1. Write the following methods in the class `LinkedList` that we have started in the classwork
   - `public boolean add (int index, T obj)` – gets an index value that may be in the range [0, size - 1] and a reference to an object ; adds the given object at the given correct index; returns true if the index is the correct and false otherwise
   - `public T remove(int index)` – gets an index value that may be in the range [0, size - 1]; removes an object at the given index; returns the reference to the removed object in the case of the correct index or null otherwise
     Note: The classwork project contains the private additional methods that you may write for the concrete cases
1. Write the test cases for above methods of the class `LinkedList`. Try to extend the tests from the previous HW
